Place logo image files in these folders so the site can render them via next/image.

Expected filenames (can be changed in src/content/site.ts):
- FleetWorks brand: public/logos/fleetworks/fleetworks.png
- Partners: public/logos/partners/highway.png, public/logos/partners/truckstop.png

Tips:
- Prefer transparent PNG or SVG.
- If a logo is dark-on-transparent, export a light/white variant for the dark UI.
